This panel allows coding the categorical variables according to different coding schemas. The coding schema applies to all parameter estimates.

Note that all contrasts but `dummy` guarantee to be centered to zero (intercept being the grand mean), so when involved in interactions the other variables coefficients can be interpret as (main) average effects. If contrast `dummy` is set, the intercept and the effects of other variables in interactions are estimated for the first group of the categorical IV.  

Contrasts definitions are provided in the estimates table. More detailed definitions of the comparisons operated by the contrasts can be obtained by selecting `Show contrast definition table`. 

Differently to standard R naming system, contrasts variables are always named with the name of the factor and a progressive number from 1 to K-1, where K is the number of levels of the factor.

In reading the contrast labels, one should interpret the `(1,2,3)` code as meaning "the mean of the levels 1,2, and 3 pooled toghether". If factor levels 1,2 and 3 are all levels of the factor in the sample, `(1,2,3)` is equivalent to "the mean of the sample". For example, for a three levels factor, a contrast labeled `1-(1,2,3)` means that the contrast is comparing the mean of level 1 against the mean of the sample. For the same factor, a contrast labeled `1-(2,3)` indicates a comparison between level 1 mean and the subsequent levels means pooled together.

The default schema is `simple`, which compares each level with a reference level and it is centered to the mean of the sample.
